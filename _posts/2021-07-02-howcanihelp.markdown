This website needs your help in a number of ways. Right now, I'm only a one man band who can only do this in my spare time and therefore I need people to help update the site, translate it and mantaining it. Below are some ways that you can help

## Translation
The directories that I'm writing will be in English and not everyone can understand English and therefore I need help to translate it Chinese. You can upload translations by just forking this repo and creating a pull request with the translations on the pages. If you don't know how to do that, just leave your translations as a text file and file it as an issue.

## Updating the directory
As more backups are being uploaded to the internet, it's getting harder and harder for me to keep track of them all and so if you know of an archive that is not on this list, please add an issue on this page's GitHub and I'll it in as soon as possible.
